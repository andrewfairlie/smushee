Smushee
========

Smushee takes any images uploaded through the ExpressionEngine control panel and pass them through Yahoo!'s smush.it

Once the extension is enabled all images will be tried to be ‘Smushed’. If they can, your file on the server will automatically be replaced with the optimised version - if for whatever reason it cannot be smushed (perhaps it is too big, or Smush.it is offline) your original image will remain.
